Develop a system within your Django application that utilizes groups and permissions to restrict access to certain parts of your application. This task will demonstrate your ability to set up detailed access controls based on user roles and their assigned permissions.

Step 1: Define Custom Permissions in Models
Add custom permissions to one of your existing models (or a new model if preferable) to control actions such as viewing, creating, editing, or deleting instances of that model.

Model Permissions to Add:
Create permissions such as can_view, can_create, can_edit, and can_delete within your chosen model.
Step 2: Create and Configure Groups with Assigned Permissions
Set up user groups in Django and assign the newly created permissions to these groups. Use Django’s admin site to manage these groups and their permissions.

Groups to Setup:
Create groups like Editors, Viewers, and Admins.
Assign appropriate permissions to each group. For example, Editors might have can_edit and can_create permissions.
Step 3: Enforce Permissions in Views
Modify your views to check for these permissions before allowing users to perform certain actions. Use decorators such as permission_required to enforce these permissions in your views.

Views to Modify or Create:
Ensure views that create, edit, or delete model instances check for the correct permissions.
Example: Use @permission_required('app_name.can_edit', raise_exception=True) to protect an edit view.
Step 4: Test Permissions
Manually test the implementation by assigning different users to groups and verifying that the permissions are enforced correctly.

Testing Approach:
Create test users and assign them to different groups.
Log in as these users and attempt to access various parts of the application to ensure that permissions are applied correctly.
Step 5: Document the Setup
Provide a concise guide or notes within your code on how the permissions and groups are set up and used in the application.
This could be in the form of comments or a simple README file.
make sure to use the variable name as defined above such as can_edit, can_create.
Deliverables:
models.py: Updated with custom permissions for at least one model.
views.py: Updated to include permission checks in relevant views.
Documentation: Comments or a README file explaining how permissions and groups are configured and used.

To complete the task of setting up groups and permissions in your Django application, follow these steps:

Step 1: Define Custom Permissions in Models
First, you need to define custom permissions in your model. Here's how you can add these permissions to an existing model.

Example:

python
Copy code
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class YourModel(models.Model):
    # Your model fields here
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view instance"),
            ("can_create", "Can create instance"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit instance"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete instance"),
        ]
This adds the custom permissions can_view, can_create, can_edit, and can_delete to the YourModel model.

Step 2: Create and Configure Groups with Assigned Permissions
Next, you'll create user groups and assign these permissions to the groups using Django’s admin site.

Create Groups:

Go to the Django admin site.
Under the "Auth" section, click "Groups".
Create groups like "Editors", "Viewers", and "Admins".
Assign Permissions:

After creating a group, click on the group name.
Under the "Permissions" section, select the appropriate permissions:
Editors: can_edit, can_create
Viewers: can_view
Admins: can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete
Step 3: Enforce Permissions in Views
Now, modify your views to enforce these permissions. You can use the @permission_required decorator to check permissions.

Example:

python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, redirect
from .models import YourModel

@permission_required('app_name.can_view', raise_exception=True)
def view_instance(request, pk):
    instance = get_object_or_404(YourModel, pk=pk)
    return render(request, 'your_template.html', {'instance': instance})

@permission_required('app_name.can_edit', raise_exception=True)
def edit_instance(request, pk):
    instance = get_object_or_404(YourModel, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle form submission and save changes
        return redirect('success_url')
    return render(request, 'edit_template.html', {'instance': instance})

@permission_required('app_name.can_delete', raise_exception=True)
def delete_instance(request, pk):
    instance = get_object_or_404(YourModel, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        instance.delete()
        return redirect('success_url')
    return render(request, 'delete_template.html', {'instance': instance})
This ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can access the views.

Step 4: Test Permissions
Manually test your implementation by creating different users, assigning them to the groups you created, and verifying that permissions work as expected.

Test Users: Create test users in the Django admin site.
Assign Groups: Assign these users to the Editors, Viewers, or Admins groups.
Verify Access: Log in as each user and try to access the views to ensure permissions are enforced.
Step 5: Document the Setup
Include comments in your code or create a README.md file that explains how the permissions and groups are set up and used.

Example:

## Permissions and Groups Setup

### Custom Permissions
- can_view: Allows viewing of YourModel instances.
- can_create: Allows creating new YourModel instances.
- can_edit: Allows editing of YourModel instances.
- can_delete: Allows deleting YourModel instances.

### Groups
- *Viewers*: Assigned can_view permission.
- *Editors*: Assigned can_create and can_edit permissions.
- *Admins*: Assigned all permissions (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete).

### Usage in Views
- The @permission_required decorator is used to enforce permissions.
- For example, the edit_instance view requires can_edit permission.
